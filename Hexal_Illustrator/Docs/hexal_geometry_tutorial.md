## Introduction to Hexal Grids

Hexagonal grids are a versatile and powerful way to represent multidimensional data in both 2D and 3D space. In Hexal Illustrator, we use flat-topped and pointy-topped hexagonal grids to visualize classical and quantum data.

### Why Hexagonal Grids?

- **Efficient packing**: Hexagons allow for efficient use of space.
- **Equidistant neighbors**: Each hexagon has six equidistant neighbors, which is useful for modeling physical systems and quantum states.
- **Flexible scaling**: Hexagons can be scaled and transformed easily without losing their core structure.

## Generating Hexal Grids

In Hexal Illustrator, you can generate hexal grids using the `HexalGrid` class. Hereâ€™s an example of how to generate a flat-topped hexagonal grid:

```python
from hexal_geometry import HexalGrid

grid = HexalGrid().generate_grid(dimensions=(10, 15), grid_size=5, orientation="flat-topped")
```

### Parameters

- **dimensions**: Specifies the width and height of the grid in hexagonal units (x, y).
- **grid_size**: Defines the size of each hexagonal cell.
- **orientation**: Determines whether the hexagons are flat-topped or pointy-topped.

## Transforming Grids

Once a hexagonal grid is generated, you can apply various transformations to it, such as scaling, rotation, and translation. The `HexalTransformations` class provides several utility functions for these operations.

### Rotating a Hexagonal Grid

```python
from hexal_geometry import HexalTransformations

transformed_grid = HexalTransformations().rotate(grid, angle=60)
```

### Scaling a Hexagonal Grid

```python
scaled_grid = HexalTransformations().scale(grid, factor=2)
```

### Translating (Shifting) a Hexagonal Grid

You can also shift the grid along its x, y, and z axes.

```python
translated_grid = HexalTransformations().translate(grid, shift_x=2, shift_y=3)
```

## Advanced Manipulation

Beyond simple transformations, you can apply more advanced manipulations to hexal grids. For instance, you can change the orientation of individual hexagons or adjust the spacing between them.

### Adjusting Grid Spacing

Grid spacing refers to the distance between hexagonal cells. You can modify this value to achieve different visual effects or represent different physical systems.

```python
grid = HexalGrid().generate_grid(dimensions=(10, 10), grid_size=5, orientation="flat-topped", grid_spacing=3.0)
```

### Multi-Layered Hexal Grids

You can also create multi-layered hexal grids, where each layer represents a different dimension or property (e.g., energy levels, time, or quantum states).

```python
multi_layer_grid = HexalGrid().generate_multi_layer_grid(layers=3, grid_size=4, orientation="pointy-topped")
```

## Quantum State Integration

Hexal grids in Hexal Illustrator are designed to integrate quantum state data, allowing you to visualize complex quantum properties like superposition, entanglement, and probability distributions.

### Associating Quantum States with Hexagons

You can associate quantum states with individual hexagonal cells. For example:

```python
quantum_data = {
    "state": "superposition",
    "probability_distribution": [0.4, 0.6],
    "spin": "1/2"
}
renderer.render_quantum_data(grid, quantum_data)
```

### Visualizing Entanglement

The system can also visualize entangled states, where the quantum state of one hexagon depends on the state of another:

```python
quantum_data = {
    "state": "entangled",
    "entanglement_factor": 0.85
}
renderer.render_quantum_data(grid, quantum_data)
```

With these techniques, you can create, transform, and visualize hexagonal grids and quantum data in a wide variety of ways. For more advanced use cases, refer to the **API Reference** and **User Guide**.
