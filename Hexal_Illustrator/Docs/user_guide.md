# Hexal Illustrator User Guide

This user guide will walk you through the various features of the Hexal Illustrator and provide detailed instructions for using the system effectively.

## Overview

Hexal Illustrator is a powerful tool for visualizing and manipulating multidimensional data, quantum states, and hexagonal grids. It allows users to load, edit, and save hexal files, and supports both classical and quantum visualizations.

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md) to install and set up Hexal Illustrator. Once installation is complete, you can begin loading and visualizing hexal structures.

## Loading and Saving Data

To load and save data, you can use the following commands in the main Python application:

### Loading Data

```python
from data_loader import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader(data_directory="path/to/data")
data = loader.load_data("example.hexal")
```

### Saving Data

```python
from data_saver import DataSaver

saver = DataSaver(save_directory="path/to/save")
saver.save("output.hexal", data)
```

The system supports JSON, CSV, and Hexal formats for data loading and saving.

## Working with Hexal Grids

Hexal grids are the foundation of the Hexal Illustrator. You can generate, transform, and manipulate grids using various functions in the **Hexal Geometry** module.

### Generating a Hexal Grid

```python
from hexal_geometry import HexalGrid

grid = HexalGrid().generate_grid(dimensions=(10, 10), grid_size=5, orientation="flat-topped")
```

### Transforming Grids

You can apply transformations to the grid, such as rotation or scaling:

```python
from hexal_geometry import HexalTransformations

transformed_grid = HexalTransformations().rotate(grid, angle=45)
```

## Quantum State Visualization

The Hexal Illustrator integrates quantum mechanics with hexal grids, allowing you to visualize quantum states like superposition and entanglement.

### Rendering Quantum Data

```python
from rendering import HexalRenderer

renderer = HexalRenderer()
renderer.render_quantum_data(grid, quantum_data={"state": "superposition", "probability_distribution": [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]})
```

## Rendering and Visualization

You can render 2D and 3D hexal grids in real-time. The **Rendering** module provides the ability to create visual representations of both classical and quantum data.

### Rendering 3D Hexal Grids

```python
renderer.render_grid(grid)
```

For Unity users, refer to the [Unity Integration](#unity-integration) section for real-time 3D rendering and interaction.

## Unity Integration

Hexal Illustrator integrates with Unity to provide real-time 3D and VR rendering capabilities.

### Setting Up Unity

1. Import the `Unity_Assets` folder into your Unity project.
2. Follow the instructions in the `Unity_Docs` to configure the environment.
3. Use the provided Unity scripts to visualize hexal grids.

### Example: Rendering Hexal Grids in Unity

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class HexalGridGenerator : MonoBehaviour {
    void Start() {
        // Call this method to generate and visualize hexal grids
        GenerateHexalGrid();
    }
    
    void GenerateHexalGrid() {
        // Hexal grid generation logic
    }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Working with Multidimensional Attributes

Hexal Illustrator supports multidimensional attributes for hexal structures, such as color, temperature, and quantum spin.

```python
attributes = {
    "color": "red",
    "opacity": 0.7,
    "quantum_spin": "1/2"
}
```

These attributes can be visualized on the grid, providing insights into quantum state properties.
