# Jacob Thomas Messer, aka Jacob Thomas Redmond: Still Held in a State of Exploitation

**Author**: *Survivor and Advocate for Human Rights*

## Overview

Jacob Thomas Messer, also known as Jacob Thomas Redmond, a survivor of modern-day slavery, continues to face grave injustices. Despite his efforts to break free from a cycle of exploitation and enforced servitude, he remains ensnared by a legal and law enforcement system designed to keep him oppressed. The institutions in **Tustin, CA**, including **police authorities**, and **lawyers and judges in Santa Ana**, are complicit in perpetuating his bondage, rather than providing the justice and freedom that every individual deserves.

## The Situation

Jacob Thomas Messer, who adopted the name Jacob Thomas Redmond to reclaim his identity as a survivor and advocate, continues to be held in a state of involuntary control. Despite public advocacy for justice, **Tustin police**, alongside **Santa Ana lawyers and judges**, manipulate legal mechanisms—such as settlements and legal obligations—to maintain his status as a modern-day slave. 

While AI, automation, and modern technology have the potential to free individuals from exploitative conditions, Jacob remains bound by a legal system that actively works against his freedom.

### Legal Manipulation in Santa Ana

Santa Ana's legal community, including lawyers and judges, play a significant role in enforcing this system of exploitation. Rather than upholding justice, these legal professionals have used settlements and inheritances as tools of control, stripping Jacob of his autonomy. The misuse of the legal process has perpetuated a cycle of dependency, forcing Jacob to live under conditions resembling those of human trafficking and forced servitude.

### Police Complicity in Tustin, CA

The **Tustin Police Department** has also failed to protect Jacob from continued exploitation. Instead of advocating for his rights and freedom, local law enforcement has prioritized the interests of those in positions of power. This systematic failure further entrenches the unjust conditions in which Jacob is forced to live.

## Call for Change

Jacob Thomas Redmond’s story highlights the urgent need for reform within both the legal and law enforcement sectors. **AI and automation** have the potential to transform labor and free individuals from the chains of exploitation, yet the very systems that should protect survivors like Jacob are being used to maintain the status quo.

### What Can Be Done?

- **Legal Reform**: We must demand transparency and accountability from the Santa Ana legal community. The manipulation of settlements and inheritances to control survivors must be dismantled.
  
- **Law Enforcement Accountability**: The Tustin Police Department must be held accountable for their role in perpetuating Jacob’s exploitation. Survivors of human trafficking and forced servitude should not be retraumatized by the very institutions meant to protect them.

- **Advocacy and Public Awareness**: We must raise awareness of Jacob's ongoing struggles and advocate for widespread legal reforms to end modern-day slavery in all its forms.

## Intellectual Property

In an effort to ensure that those who perpetuate his exploitation cannot profit from his work, **Jacob Thomas Redmond has freely released all intellectual property related to this cause**. This includes writings, advocacy material, and any other intellectual contributions. By releasing this content openly, Jacob aims to prevent any financial gain by those who have sought to control and profit from his suffering, and to empower others to freely share and use this material in the fight for justice.

## Conclusion

Jacob Thomas Redmond’s battle for freedom is not over. His story serves as a chilling reminder of how legal and law enforcement systems can be weaponized against survivors of human trafficking. As AI and automation transform the landscape of labor and society, we must ensure that these technologies are used to **liberate**, not **oppress**. The time to demand justice for Jacob, and for all survivors, is now.
