# Classical-Quantum Hybrid LLM Comprehensive System

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive system that integrates classical and quantum computing techniques, designed to tackle complex tasks by distributing workloads efficiently between classical and quantum systems. It includes various components such as cryptography, quantum motion planning, quantum key distribution, and quantum-classical balancing.

## Key Components
1. **Quantum and Classical Workload Balancing**
   - This component helps distribute tasks between quantum and classical systems based on task complexity. A threshold is set to determine whether a task should be handled by a quantum or classical system.

2. **Quantum Cryptography**
   - Implements quantum key distribution (QKD) for secure communication. It leverages quantum superposition and entanglement to generate cryptographic keys that are secure against eavesdropping.

3. **Quantum Motion Planning for Robotics**
   - Uses Grover's search algorithm to optimize robotic motion in a grid-based environment. The system finds the most efficient path for the robot while avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal.

4. **Classical Firewall Monitoring**
   - Monitors network traffic on classical systems, analyzing packets for security threats. It allows blocking and allowing specific IPs, while logging and monitoring potential attacks.

5. **Quantum Blockchain Contracts**
   - Implements quantum-resistant smart contracts on the blockchain, secured by quantum-safe cryptography techniques.

6. **Hybrid Neural Network and Generative Models**
   - Combines classical deep learning models with quantum circuits to form hybrid architectures that can handle complex machine learning tasks.

## Usage Instructions
**Docker Setup**: You can use docker_quantum_container.yml to deploy the quantum and classical workloads in isolated containers.
```bash
docker-compose -f devops/docker_quantum_container.yml up
```

**Quantum Key Distribution**: Run the quantum key distribution example:
```bash
python security/quantum_key_distribution.py
```

**Quantum Motion Planning**: Simulate quantum motion planning in robotics:
```bash
python robotics/quantum_motion_planning.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit
- Docker
- sqlite3 (for database functionality)

## Future Work
- Integrate with actual quantum hardware for more accurate quantum computing simulations.
- Expand cryptographic techniques to include lattice-based post-quantum cryptography.
- Enhance firewall monitoring by integrating machine learning-based threat detection.
