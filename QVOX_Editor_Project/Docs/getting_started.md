# Getting Started with the QVOX Editor

Welcome to the **QVOX Editor**, a powerful tool for creating, editing, and visualizing voxel-based multidimensional data, including quantum states and attributes.

## System Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyQt5**: For the graphical user interface.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations and quantum state management.
- **OpenGL**: For 3D rendering of voxel grids and quantum states.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/qvox-editor.git
   cd qvox-editor
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the QVOX Editor:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Basic Usage

- **Creating a New Voxel Grid**: You can create a new voxel grid by specifying the grid dimensions in the Voxel Editor.
- **Loading a QVOX File**: Use the `File -> Open` menu to load an existing QVOX file for editing.
- **Editing Voxels**: Select individual voxels in the 3D viewer and use the attribute editor to modify their quantum states and multidimensional attributes.
- **Saving Changes**: Save your work using the `File -> Save` menu to export your voxel grid and quantum states back to a QVOX file.

## Navigation

- **Zooming**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the voxel grid.
- **Panning**: Click and drag with the right mouse button to pan around the voxel space.
- **Rotating**: Click and drag with the left mouse button to rotate the voxel grid in 3D.
