# Quantum SQL Syntax
# This document outlines the SQL-like syntax for interacting with quantum states.

## Basic Operations
Quantum SQL provides a simplified, SQL-like interface for interacting with quantum systems.

### 1. APPLY GATES
Apply quantum gates such as Hadamard, CNOT, and Phase Shift.

Example:
```
APPLY HADAMARD 0;
APPLY CNOT 0 1;
APPLY PHASE 0 3.14;
```

### 2. MEASUREMENT
Measure quantum states and collapse the wavefunction.

Example:
```
MEASURE;
```

### 3. ENTANGLEMENT
Apply entanglement between two qubits.

Example:
```
APPLY ENTANGLE 0 1;
```

## Extended Capabilities
- You can define specific quantum states and operate on them by name.
- Observer-dependent dynamics may modify the query result based on user context.
- Support for hybrid quantum-classical queries and machine learning extensions.

This document is a work in progress and subject to updates as Quantum SQL evolves.
