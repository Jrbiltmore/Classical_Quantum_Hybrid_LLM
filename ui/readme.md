# Classical-Quantum Hybrid LLM Dashboard

## Overview
This dashboard is designed to monitor and manage classical and quantum hybrid machine learning models. The system integrates classical neural networks with quantum computing techniques to enhance model performance and scalability. 

## Features
- **Real-time Model Monitoring**: Track the performance of classical, quantum, and hybrid models.
- **Data Upload and Preprocessing**: Easily upload and preprocess datasets for both classical and quantum models.
- **Security**: Secure quantum and classical communications with cutting-edge cryptography.
- **Quantum and Classical Optimizations**: Leverage hybrid optimizations for better performance.
- **Scalability**: The dashboard is containerized using Docker and can be deployed in a Kubernetes environment for scalability.
