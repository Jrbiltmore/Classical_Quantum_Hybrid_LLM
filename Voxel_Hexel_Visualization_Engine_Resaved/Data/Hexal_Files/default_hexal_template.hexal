
# Default Hexal Template for Voxel-Hexel Visualization Engine - Multidimensional, Cross-Disciplinary, with Operational Flags
# This template supports individual cell activation flags and configuration options for large-scale deployments.

hexal_grid:
  dimensions: 256  # High-resolution grid suitable for multidimensional applications
  default_value: 0  # Represents inactive cells in the grid by default
  operational_config:
    # Configuration option to control whether the entire grid is operational or not
    grid_operational: True  # Set to True to activate grid, False to deactivate entire grid
  dimensions_supported:
    - spatial: 3D  # X, Y, Z for physical, geographical, or medical data mapping
    - quantum_state: 1D  # For quantum data, such as superposition or entanglement
    - time_series: 1D  # Temporal data for capturing time-based changes within the grid
  cells:
    # Each cell has an operational flag, allowing individual control over whether the cell is active
